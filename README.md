# Workbook-Assignment-6-pg-63

This Assignment 6 outcome was to analyze data utilizing regressional analysis. The goal of the assignment was to first
create a new column from existing data to correlate a string into numerical values, specifically female == 1 and male ==0.
Furthermore, importing statsmodels to analyze the value of a dependent variable. 

In conclusion, adding the new column to create a numerical value for male & female enabled me to add numerical information to
the R-square value.

Choosing to only have exercise, hours, and gender_val converted the R-Squared outcome to experience a increase by .001.
